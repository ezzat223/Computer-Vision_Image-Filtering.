# Computer-Vision_Image-Filtering.
## 1- Add additive noise to the image. 
####   - For example: Uniform, Gaussian and salt & pepper noise. 
## 2- Filter the noisy image using the following low pass filters. 
####   -Average, Gaussian and median filters. 
## 3- Detect edges in the image using the following masks 
####   -Sobel , Roberts , Prewitt and Canny edge detectors. 
## 4- Draw histogram and distribution curve. 
## 5- Equalize the image. 
## 6- Normalize the image. 
## 7- Local and global thresholding. 
## 8- Transformation from color image to gray scale image and plot of R, G, and B histograms with its distribution function (cumulative curve that you use it for mapping and histogram equalization). 
## 9- Frequency domain filters (high pass and low pass). 
## 10- Hybrid images
